## Indie Turn Based Strategy in Isometric Pixel Art

Classic turn-based strategy game with two armies fighting against each other. Challenge yourself in campaign against AI or hot-seat battle with a friend. Using easy map editor you can create any imaginable scenario to play and share online for others to discover!

Each 32x32 sprite was handcrafted in gorgeous, 32 colour pixel art. Original soundtrack was made on Access Virus C and Korg Electribe. Sound effects were made on real GameBoy hardware. Game is open-source and runs smoothly thanks to Godot Engine.
