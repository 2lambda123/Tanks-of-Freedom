MISSION_TITLE_MAYDAY_SQUARE,"MayDay Square"
MISSION_DESR_MAYDAY_SQUARE,"After days of protests, we finally say enough is enough. Corruption and abuse must stop! Protesters of MayDay Square are ready to fight! Take command of the freedom fighters and assault the Presidental Palace."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir! We are ready to begin the assault on the Presidental Palace! Our troops are awaiting your orders."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_OBJECTIVE,"This is the enemy HQ. We need to bring our soldiers there and capture it. Without central command, military forces guarding the Palace will disperse."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_1,"We should also claim as many communication towers as possible to gain more resources for our operations. Those are crucial, as we need to pay for the deployment of new units, and movement of those already in the field."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_2,"Our enemy is already capturing nearby towers, we need to hurry and take them back to gain advantage!"
MISSION_1_SOLDIER_SHOUT,"You are outnumbered! Stand down and let us get that corrupted bastard!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_ORDER,"Fall back soldier!"
MISSION_1_GUARD,"Rebel scum!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_COMMAND,"Sir! Our forces are on the edge, we need you to take command!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_NEARBY,"Palace defence HQ is close. Let's take it!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEFEND,"Sir! Enemy forces are getting dangerously close to our HQ! We should drive them back, otherwise we risk loosing this battle!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEPLOY,"Our forces have taken significant losses. We should deploy more soldiers from our HQ."
MISSION_TITLE_EASTERN_CITY,"Eastern city"
MISSION_DESR_EASTERN_CITY,"Even though the events of MayDay Square allowed for a relatively peaceful change of government, there is still a lot of tension. We have reports of a group of militants loyal to the old president. Find and capture their center of operations before their actions cause civil war."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir, recently we've been getting reports of increased militia activity in this region. We suspect there might be an organized command centre nearby. We should investigate."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS,"Our forces are limited here. We should secure these infantry barracks. This building will enable us to deploy new soldiers for a lower price."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_TIPOFF,"Sir! We just got a tip off from local civilians indicating the location of the militia HQ. This is our objective."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_1,"Great work, Sir."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_2,"Please be advised, that claiming buildings other than communication towers will require our soldier to stay inside, so make sure we always have enough infantry on the battlefield."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_3,"There were some recruits waiting in the barracks. They have joined us."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_1,"Deploying more units will cost us resources, same as moving them. Spend them wisely."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_2,"In order to deploy a unit, dedicated spawn tile next to the building must be free. If one of your units occupies that tile, you have to move it first."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_3,"You can use this to your advantage as well. Blocking spawn tiles next to enemy buildings will prevent them from deploying reinforcements."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_ALARM,"They have found us! Raise the alarm!"
MISSION_TITLE_RIOTS,"Riots"
MISSION_DESR_RIOTS,"The current government came to power by attacking our dear leader! And they dare to call us the rebels! New authorities are still weak. We should use this opportunity to take over key administration offices. Our forces are standing by and awaiting your orders!"
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Commander. Apologies for the delays."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"We finally managed to set up a camp. Wasn't easy to gather troops after we lost controll of the army."
MISSION_3_OBJECTIVE,"Our objective is to take the City Hall. Local defense forces are still disorganized. We should use this window of opportunity."
MISSION_3_TANK_1,"Our militiants managed to steal a tank from nearby military base. It won't be long before someone notices."
MISSION_3_TANK_2,"Tanks are great at dealing with infantry - this one will be a valuble asset in this mission. Still, we need more if we are to succeed."
MISSION_3_TANK_FACTORY,"There is a tank fabrication facility nearby. Take it before the enemy uses those heavy units to stop our assault."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_1,"Great work, Commander. Nothing will stop us now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_2,"Local defense forces ordered a tank recently. I guess it is ours now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_AI,"Commander, this is not good! Local forces have taken active controll of this factory. We need to re-take it, or we will face a lot more tanks that we can handle."
MISSION_TITLE_BASE_ASSAULT,"Base Assault"
MISSION_DESR_BASE_ASSAULT,"Our recent victory gave us a foothold, but we can not stop there. A nearby military base has a lot of equipment we could use! We have to attack before they realise that they are no longer in control of this region."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Great work on securing a foothold Commander, but our work here is not yet done."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"If we are to secure our presence in this region, we have to take over the military base."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"Armoured units are available. Expect the enemy base to deploy tanks of their own!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_1,"We've managed to cut off their landline communications, Commander. We should be able to overwhelm them before they can even call for help."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_2,"Still, we should not waste any time. They can still use comm towers."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_1,"This is perimeter base! We are under attack! Repeat, we are under attack!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_2,"This is not good, they managed to restore communications. We have to prepare for reinforcements."
MISSION_4_RAPID_RESPONSE,"Rapid response unit reporting in!"
MISSION_4_FORWARD_BARRACK,"Capturing these forward barracks would allow us to bring soldiers to the front line more easily."
MISSION_4_GUARD_WARN,"Rebels are getting close!"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_1,"With both towers near their HQ we knocked out their comms completely."
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_2,"What the... ? Command, come in. Anyone?"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_3,"Good luck with that."
MISSION_TITLE_PENINSULA,"Peninsula"
MISSION_DESR_PENINSULA,"Days of fighting are finnally paying off. Now we have the support of our strong neighbouring country. We are ready to push the usurpers out of the peninsula. When we succeed, there will be no way for them to re-take it. This will be our greatest victory!"
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Government forces throughout the peninsula are busy fighting local militia."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"With a cooridnated push, we can take controll of this land before they can re-organize."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"This base safeguards a strategic route connecting the peninsula with the rest of the country. Taking controll of this facility will cut off all remaining army, forcing them to surrender."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_1,"This is an airforce outpost meant to support the main base. Defences seem to be minimal, they did not expect an attack from this direction."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_2,"We should claim this building for additional air support."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_1,"There is more equipment here, than we expected. They probably regret loosing this outpost already."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_2,"Attack helicopter reporting for duty."
MISSION_5_FLANK,"With the right flank secured, we were able to bring in some reinforcements."
MISSION_5_BLOCK_1,"You will not get away with this, traitors!"
MISSION_5_BLOCK_2,"It is you, who betrayed our great President! Arrest him!"
MISSION_TITLE_RECAPTURE,"Recapture"
MISSION_DESR_RECAPTURE,"The situation is deteriorating quickly. We have to start pushing back, or we will lose all of our progress in this conflict. We are ready to liberate the city, where the rebels began their operations. Let us show them, and the people, that simple bandits are no match for our military."
MISSION_6_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Sir. As you may already know, recent setbacks have put us in an unfavourable position. We have to start pushing back."
MISSION_6_INTRO_2,"Our intel suggests, that this city is where it all started. Rebel activity appears to have lessened since the initial attack - they probably moved on."
MISSION_6_INTRO_3,"Still, we should not underestimate the garrison stationed here. Liberating this city will be an important step in our campaign."
MISSION_6_INTRO_4,"Sir, the base of operations is up and running."
MISSION_6_INTRO_5,"Good."
MISSION_6_INTRO_6,"Air support reporting in."
MISSION_6_INTRO_7,"We've got decent amount of ground units, though our air capabilities are limited for this engagement. Use these assets well."
MISSION_6_APP_BASE,"Sir, this looks like an abandoned rebel encampment. It seems they had no way of moving all this equipment, so they just left it."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_1,"There are two comm towers on the left flank."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_2,"There may be some AA emplacements in the area, but if we capture those towers, we will be able to guide in more air support safely."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_3,"Anti-tank team has arrived."
MISSION_6_PATROL_1,"Patrol squad reporting back."
MISSION_6_PATROL_2,"No rest for you, we are under attack!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_1,"We are loosing ground! Warn the Commander!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_2,"Yes Sir!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_3,"He got away. Doesn't matter, let's focus on the mission at hand."
MISSION_TITLE_BASE_DEFENCE,"Base Defence"
MISSION_DESR_BASE_DEFENCE,"Alert! Rebels are attacking one of our military bases in the eastern region! We can't allow them to capture any more of our assets. Defend the base and destroy the rebel forces in the region!"
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_1,"Airport Pt.1"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_1,"Fighting between our militia and the government forces is not going as well as we had hoped. We need to show the world we are not giving up just yet. The nearby airport is not of huge strategic importance, but capturing it will be our manifestation of power!"
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPLANE,"Airplane"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPLANE,"Thanks to the airport equipment, we have intercepted communications about an important military aircraft flying over the area. We have identified the perfect spot to launch missiles from, but it is guarded by the enemy. Muster your forces and get into position to shoot down the transport!"
MISSION_TITLE_FIELD_COMMAND,"Field Command"
MISSION_DESR_FIELD_COMMAND,"These separatists just shot down a civilian airplane, hundreds of people died! Their violence has to stop! Our scouts have found the enemy field command center for this region. Our resources are limited, but we should be able to gather more men and tanks in the nearby city."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_2,"Airport Pt.2"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_2,"The rebel forces have scattered after losing their local HQ. The airport is still heavily guarded, but they will not receive any new reinforcements anytime soon. Our Recon-Team managed to set up a small base.  We need to attack before they can pick themselves up!"
MISSION_TITLE_CONVOY,"Convoy"
MISSION_DESR_CONVOY,"In this time of war many people are suffering. Our kind neighbour offered to send us a humanitarian convoy with food, water and medicine. The government does not believe in our good intentions, and won't allow the trucks to pass. We have to clear the way!"
MISSION_TITLE_CRASH_SITE,"Crash Site"
MISSION_DESR_CRASH_SITE,"The plane we attacked went down deep within the forest. We must not allow anyone to reach the crash site. Without the wreckage, no one will be able to prove by whom and how it was destroyed. International investigators are on their way, we have to stop them."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_3,"Airport Pt.3"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_3,"It has been months since we started fighting over this wretched airport. It is hardly an airport anymore either, with everything reduced to rubble - the terminal, the tower, the surrounding city. Even so, it is still a symbol of who has the upper hand here, and it should be ours!"
