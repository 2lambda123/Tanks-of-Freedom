KEY_GENERAL,Did you know that ...
KEY_HINT_1,Each unit can attack only once a turn
KEY_HINT_2,Units have own weaknesses and advantages - only troops can capture buildings but they have almost no chance against tanks and tanks can’t attack helis
KEY_HINT_3,You can deploy soldiers in HQ but it is cheaper to do so in the barracks
KEY_HINT_4,Unit losses all his remaining AP in turn when capturing Tower
KEY_HINT_5,All production buildings require a soldier to maintain it - capturing them will cost you a soldier unit
KEY_HINT_6,HQ and captured Towers or Airports will produce cash in every turn
KEY_HINT_7,Cash can be spend for deploying units and movement
KEY_HINT_8,Use your cash wisely - a big army will be slower and less effective than a small squad
KEY_HINT_9,It’s never a good idea to send a unit alone to the battlefield
KEY_HINT_10,Mixing unit types in squads gives you a strategic advantage
KEY_HINT_11,You cannot deploy unit when spawning point is blocked and so do the enemy - block factories with your units
KEY_HINT_12,Units can attack only adjacent tiles - so when target is far away you should firstly move your unit
KEY_HINT_13,HQ is the most valuable building in game - if you capture enemy HQ you will win the game, losing it means instant defeat
