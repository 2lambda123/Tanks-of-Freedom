TIP_HEADER,Did you know that...
TIP_1,Each unit can attack only once a turn
TIP_2,Units have own weaknesses and advantages - only troops can capture buildings but they have almost no chance against tanks and tanks can’t attack helis
TIP_3,You can deploy soldiers in HQ but it is cheaper to do so in the barracks
TIP_4,Unit losses all his remaining AP in turn when capturing Tower
TIP_5,All production buildings require a soldier to maintain it - capturing them will cost you a soldier unit
TIP_6,HQ and captured Towers or Airports will produce cash in every turn
TIP_7,Cash can be spend for deploying units and movement
TIP_8,Use your cash wisely - a big army will be slower and less effective than a small squad
TIP_9,It’s never a good idea to send a unit alone to the battlefield
TIP_10,Mixing unit types in squads gives you a strategic advantage
TIP_11,You cannot deploy unit when spawning point is blocked and so do the enemy - block factories with your units
TIP_12,Units can attack only adjacent tiles - so when target is far away you should firstly move your unit
TIP_13,HQ is the most valuable building in game - if you capture enemy HQ you will win the game, losing it means instant defeat
